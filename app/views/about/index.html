					<h3>Our Vision</h3>

					<p>We envision a world where 1) everyone is involved in their communities and able to hold their leaders accountable, 2) leaders of all kinds are able to break through the noise and lead, organize, mobilize, and engage with ease, and 3) democracy thrives in all kinds of communities and engagement is simple, effective, and pain-free.</p> 

					<h3>Our Mission</h3>

					<p>Our mission is simple: to strengthen democracy, civic engagement, and civil society with purposeful, accessible technology. Powerline is dedicated to strengthening democracy and supporting leader-community relationships. Our technology connects individuals to their elected leaders and towns automatically, and allows people to create or join any kind of group on the platform. It provides a prioritized, two-way communication pathway that enables leaders and communities alike to break through the noise and be heard.</p> 

					<h3>Our Product</h3>
					<p>Powerline is a mobile app and web platform that provides leaders and communities with the tools they need to break through the noise and interact with each other effectively. Polls, petitions, discussions, announcements, fundraisers, events, and so much more are streamlined into one easy-to-use, open, social system. People can stay connected, create movements, and influence change with unprecedented ease.  Useful in both political and non-political contexts, Powerline's communities are combined with an advanced analytics platform and public reporting capabilities. This enables leaders, the public, organizations, and the media to better understand the voice of everyday people in any community. Powerline automatically links citizens to their elected leaders providing them with a two-way communication channel as well as relevant background, contact, and voting information. It helps busy, everyday people (like you) participate in democracy by simplifying traditionally-burdensome activism processes. Learn more about features and benefits below.</p> 

					<h3>Our Theory of Change</h3>
					<p>Throughout the world, power is shifting from those at the top to those who participate. Leaders must adopt "new power leadership" practices in order to be effective and responsive. These practices include shared decision-making, inclusive communications, broad-spectrum participatory engagement, collective action, grassroots initiatives, and connection-based influencing. In a networked, connected society, the right technology is needed to help break through the noise and enable these types of leaders and organizations. Yet, this technology also must serve the interests and needs of busy citizens so that they can engage in simple, meaningful ways in the world outside of work, family, and friends.</p> 

					<p>With purposeful technology, we can enable easy and effective engagement and drive democratic participation in any kind of community – a town, a school, a business or a non-profit. Powerline works to systemically strengthen democracy and civil society by simplifying engagement and fortifying leader-citizen relationships everywhere. The accessible, open system helps organizations scale their impact, get and keep citizens involved, and supports accountability and transparency for democracy.</p>
