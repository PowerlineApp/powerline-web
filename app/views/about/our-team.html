						<h3>Board Of Directors</h3>

						<p>Balance is critical to everything in life and we believe it’s especially important for an organization like ours. As a hybrid of both a technology company and a civic-mission social enterprise, we must have a a board representing different political philosophies and backgrounds in order to be balanced and successful in our goals.</p>
						
						<p><img src="img/teampage_img.jpg" ><br/><span class="caption">L to R: Tara Christiansen (Volunteer), Gavin Christiansen (Volunteer), Jesse Chen (Board), Wes Farrow (Board), Matt Schneider (Volunteer)</span></p>

						<p>Our Board of Directors serves a number of functions including the following:</p>
						<ul>
					    	<li>Guardians of the public trust and of our social mission</li>
					    <li>Financial audit review and oversight</li>
					    <li>Strategic planning advisory</li>
							
						 
						</ul>
					

						<p>In order to meet these functions and be balanced, we have put together a team of professionals with experience across business, public service, and technology. Even though we purposely have equal representation of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans, the entire Powerline Board puts civic engagement and democracy itself ahead of any political interests. The Board must approve both financial audits and what we call “integrity” audits – checks to make sure that our business and our technology are each working with integrity.</p>

						<p>Our Board members are in volunteer, non-paid positions and do not benefit financially from the company, enabling them to make independent and authoritative decisions that help serve our mission first and our profits second. We thank them for their dedication and commitment to this organization and the greater mission of enhancing civic engagement.
				
				<!-- 	<p>Powerline Board Member Profiles (Alphabetical Listing)</p>
					
					<p>Project Engage stands at the intersection of technology, civic engagement, business and politics. As such, we must have a balanced team with strengths and experience in these areas. Our growing Board of Directors features the former White House Director of Presidential Quality of two Presidents, the youngest chief of staff in NJ state legislature history, an award-winning social entrepreneur, an award-winning financial management entrepreneur, a systems development consultant, and a government relations and contracting consultant. </p>

					<h3>Adam Lowy (Republican)</h3> 
					<p>New Jersey native, Springsteen fan, and Sun Devil for life, Adam graduated from Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business in 2008 with a degree in Marketing. While he was at ASU, Adam served as the Director of Events for the campus-wide undergraduate student programming board. Immediately after graduating, Adam started with a small boutique marketing agency specializing in customer retention. He found that he was not satisfied and began to think of alternate career options when he realized there was one right in front of him. His family has owned a moving company in New Jersey for over 90 years.  After years of seeing so much food wasted when people move, Adam saw an opportunity to take action. He left his job in the summer of 2009, and founded the non-profit hunger relief organization Move For Hunger where he is now Executive Director.</p>

					<p>Since its founding, Move For Hunger has grown to become a major force in US hunger relief efforts expanding to work with hundreds of relocation companies across America.
