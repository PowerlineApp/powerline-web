						<ul>
							
							<li><p><span>How can I register?</span></p><p> Please search for Powerline in the Google Play or Apple iTunes app stores. You can register by tapping on the New User icon from the main screen in the upper-left corner.</p></li>
							
							<li><p><span>Why does the app link me to my elected leaders and my town, state, and country?</span></p><p> Powerline is designed to make it easy for you to be heard by your elected leaders and to stay informed on what movements are happening in your communities. We link you to your leaders and public communities for you to make your life easier. You can’t undo this, but we do give you the option to turn off some notifications from these sources.</p></li>
							
							<li><p><span>How do I find out who my elected leaders are?</span></p><p> In the Powerline App, visit “My Elected Representatives” from the Main Menu. This feature is only available in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Mexico. In other countries, we only link users to their local, state/province, and country communities. All users can join any group. </p></li>
							
							<li><p><span>What about my privacy?</span></p><p> Powerline provides a link between you and the leaders/groups in your life. As such, there are times when it makes sense for your information to be shared and other times when it doesn’t. We don’t share your identity unless we need to. For example, many elected leaders will not even read a communication from a citizen unless they know the name, town, and state of that citizen and can confirm that they’re actually a constituent. Learn more here…  </p></li>
							
							<li><p><span>When I make a comment on an elected leader’s poll, can s/he see my identity?</span></p><p> Yes. Although we allow you to hide your identity from your fellow community members and followers, we want people to know that leaders can always see the identity of people who make comments. We believe this will help keep conversations civil and respectful. </p></li>
							
							<li><p><span>What are posts and how do I use them?</span></p><p> These are 300-character posts that you can make to a group. They can be agreed, disagreed, and discussed by other group members. If enough people agree with your post, it is boosted out to the entire group to discuss!</p></li>
							
							<li><p><span>Can I create regular petitions?</span></p><p> Yes – There are higher character limits on regular petitions compared to posts.</p></li>
